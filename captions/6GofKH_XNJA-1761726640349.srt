00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
Good evening!

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,270
You 're watching South 
Africa Why So Serious

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,600
News.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,110
I 'm Dan — here 's your 
daily dose of drama.

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,400
Deputy Police Minister 
Castle Matale has

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,910
described the police 
minister 's decision to

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,530
disband the political 
killings task team as ``

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,510
highly irregular.

9
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,970
'' Only in SA can 
operational challenges be

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,770
solved by simply 
ignoring them!

11
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,440
Meanwhile, at the 
Madlanga Commission, forensic

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,900
analysts are busy 
clarifying discrepancies,

13
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,570
proving once again that 
crime scene evidence is

14
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,610
just a suggestion.

15
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,700
Another plot twist!

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,040
In other news, the DA 
has launched a bold

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,120
proposal to scrap the 
Black Economic

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,680
Empowerment policy, 
claiming it benefits only

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,280
the elite.

20
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,900
Because who needs 
economic growth when you can

21
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,150
just change the rules?

22
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,830
As we gear up for the 
G20 summit, Mayor Leagaza

23
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,960
is confident South 
Africa will shine.

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,520
Let ’ s hope the only 
thing that gets lost is

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,500
the Wi-Fi signal!

26
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,010
That 's your daily dose 
of drama — where the

27
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,520
scandals are serious, 
but the anchor is n't.

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
Goodnight, Mzansi.
